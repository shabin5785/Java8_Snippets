	Sometimes, we need to perform advance date time manipulation such as adjusting date to first day 
	of next month or adjusting date to next working day or adjusting date to next public holiday then 
	we can use TemporalAdjusters to meet our needs. Java 8 comes bundled with many predefined temporal 
	adjusters for common scenarios. These temporal adjusters are available as static factory methods 
	inside the TemporalAdjusters class.
